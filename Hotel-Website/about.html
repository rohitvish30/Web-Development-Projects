          <p>The hotel was not only clean and tidy but infact the restaurant food was also really tasty. Facilities were good and Manager was really friendly. We received pickup from the airport without any extra charges. Such is the culture of this Hotel. I really enjoyed my 2 night stay over here. </p>
